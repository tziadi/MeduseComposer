    XP's open workspace borrows from the concept of the war room. Studies have shown that teams working tightly together in&#xD;
    close proximity achieve much greater productivity than when they are apart in their own separate offices or cubicles.&#xD;
    In XP, all members of the team, including the customer, sit in the open workspace.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The ideal XP programming environment is an open workspace filled with tables and room for pairs of people to work&#xD;
    together and maintain contact with their peers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The open workspace should foster an environment in which programmers can focus on their problems but still hear enough&#xD;
    to jump in other conversations if they can help. It is an environment that emphasizes teamwork.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In many places in the world, businesses have &quot;cubicle cultures.&quot; In the interests of privacy and enhanced&#xD;
    concentration, programmers often spend most of their time in their own workspace that is separated from their peers. It&#xD;
    acts as a little capsule of solitude that lets them work in &quot;peace.&quot; While everyone needs quiet time and some privacy,&#xD;
    the bulk of software development work is best done collaboratively.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When people go into their small workspaces, they are out of the flow and exchange of information that keeps a project&#xD;
    vigorous.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In XP, team members should have some private space. They need a place where they can use a phone privately or browse&#xD;
    email, but software development should be done in an open workspace.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
