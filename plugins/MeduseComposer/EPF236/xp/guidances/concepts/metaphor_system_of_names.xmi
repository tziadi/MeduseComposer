    Description&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This metaphor is a design overview. It is a way of defining the system using a commonly understandable vocabulary with&#xD;
    its associated relationships. It allows the whole team to talk about the structure of the software in a convenient and&#xD;
    memorable way. A good metaphor is one that all team members can understand easily, remember, and always keep in the&#xD;
    back of their minds. It provides a unifying direction that developers can follow as they build the system a small piece&#xD;
    at a time.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Metaphors are not always easy to find at the start of a project. In that case, teams can simply identify the key&#xD;
    objects and their interactions in the system (System of Names). The real metaphor might emerge later on. When everybody&#xD;
    on the team can explain quickly the system through its major objects and their interactions, the goal has been reached.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The iterative nature of XP causes the architecture of our system to evolve over time. The metaphor is not static; it&#xD;
    will change and hopefully improve over time as our understanding of the system improves.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An example of a metaphor would be something like: &quot;It's like a subway system with passengers and stations, tickets and&#xD;
    turnstiles, etc.&quot;.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Benefits&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Communication&lt;/b>: customer and developer define a common language they can use to talk about the system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Direction&lt;/b>: the metaphor helps guide the developers towards the solution.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
