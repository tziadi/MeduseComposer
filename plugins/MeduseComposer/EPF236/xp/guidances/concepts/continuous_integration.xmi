    Description&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the goals of XP is to ensure that the customer can feel and touch actual progress that reflects the investment&#xD;
    to date. As the team builds the software incrementally according to the customer's priority, the new functionality is&#xD;
    continuously integrated and demonstrated to the customer.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Integration in XP can happen several times a day. As developers finish some work, they integrate what they have done.&#xD;
    Typically, integration is done on an integration machine in order to serialize the process. Integration is supported by&#xD;
    unit tests and acceptance tests. When a pair of programmers first sits at the integration machine, the current code&#xD;
    base passes all tests. They start by integrating their changes into the code and checking for conflicts. Then, they run&#xD;
    all tests. Should any test fail, the pair is responsible for fixing the code and making it pass. Since the tests were&#xD;
    all passed before, the failures are in some way related to the modifications that have made to the code. Once all the&#xD;
    tests have passed, the integration can be considered a success and another pair can now integrate its changes. The&#xD;
    integrated build can then be handed over to the customer, who can see the new functionality on a running system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This practice obviously requires the use of tools and an environment that supports fast integration/build/test cycles.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Benefits&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Simplified and faster integrations&lt;/b>: reduces important conflicts associated with big bang integration and&#xD;
        insures that people are working with the latest version of the code.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Improved feedback&lt;/b>: shows constant and demonstrable progress (it takes a running system to pass the&#xD;
        customer's acceptance tests).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>System always shippable&lt;/b>: the latest version of the system passing all tests is always available.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
