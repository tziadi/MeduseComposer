    The assumption in XP is that software development is not a sprint but a marathon. While a sprinter will easily beat a&#xD;
    marathon runner over a very short distance, the marathon runner will always win in the long run. Consistently working&#xD;
    overtime will destroy the team, the design, and eventually the product. It creates an environment that makes it&#xD;
    impossible to do high quality work. People make more mistakes because they are tired (not to mention their low morale),&#xD;
    causing bugs that require a lot of time to fix down the line. The end result is that it slows everything and everyone&#xD;
    down.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Continuous overtime can be a symptom of a deeper problem that is not being addressed. Perhaps the process is too broken&#xD;
    to be fixed by working more. The rule in XP is that, if the team has to do more than one consecutive week of overtime,&#xD;
    it should reassess the situation and start rethinking the plan. Overtime is OK if you need to get to the end of an&#xD;
    iteration or a release, but it should always be an exception rather than the rule.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Sustainable pace is about fostering a team that can produce a consistent amount of work over a long period of time.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Benefits&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Improved predictability&lt;/b>: plans become more accurate.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Improved product quality&lt;/b>: programmers have the time to do the right thing.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Improved job satisfaction&lt;/b>: programmers can enjoy their work with as little stress as possible.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Reduced time to market&lt;/b>: less time required to fix bad code and rotting design.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
