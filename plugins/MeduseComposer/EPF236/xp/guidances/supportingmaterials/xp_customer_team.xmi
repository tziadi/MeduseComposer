    The customer team provides the requirements, sets the priorities and steers the project. The customer team can be made&#xD;
    up of one or more business representatives from different parts of the organization. If there is more than one&#xD;
    representative, it is important that the customer team speak to the developers in one voice (&quot;The Customer&quot;) in order&#xD;
    to keep communication focused. It is best if the customer team includes a real end user who knows the domain and what&#xD;
    is needed. There may be a manager, providing resources, handling external communication and coordinating activities.&#xD;
    The team may include testers, who help the customer define the customer acceptance tests. Analysts may also help to&#xD;
    define the requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
