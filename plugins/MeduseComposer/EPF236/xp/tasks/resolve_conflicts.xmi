  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Software projects require the coordinated efforts of many people. The &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../xp/guidances/concepts/xp_practices.html&quot; guid=&quot;2.2937799026801584E-305&quot;>XP Practices&lt;/a> leverage the ability of teams to collaborate and communicate about decisions and activities on the&#xD;
    project. Because team members are working together in an &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../xp/guidances/guidelines/open_workspace.html&quot; guid=&quot;3.269440809144354E-305&quot;>Open Workspace&lt;/a>, interpersonal conflicts are visible, not hidden by the separation of the cubicles. One byproduct of&#xD;
    increased collaboration, communication, and feedback will be increased conflict. Unmanaged, this conflict may increase&#xD;
    the risk to the project. XP, as a process, does not try to solve all of the problems that occur on a software project,&#xD;
    it just enables the people to solve them.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The XP Coach must make sure these conflicts are managed. The coach must help the team develop an environment of&#xD;
    openness, where conflicts can be discussed and resolved. Conflicts left unresolved, like defects left undetected, are&#xD;
    usually more disruptive and ultimately costly to fix. At times, the coach will take ownership to resolve a conflict on&#xD;
    the team or across teams, but over time, the coach must ensure that the team is capable of resolving most conflicts on&#xD;
    their own.&#xD;
