  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Pair Programming is an Extreme Programming best practice. The basic rule regarding pair programming in XP is that all&#xD;
    production code is developed in pairs. One programmer has the responsibility to complete a task. That programmer asks&#xD;
    other programmers to pair with him to complete the task. The pairings are short term, usually less than half a day.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Find a partner who has experience or skill you need to complete your task. Your task may include modifying a database&#xD;
    table. Ask the person on the team most knowledgeable to help you effectively use the database API. Later, you might&#xD;
    need to display the data in a GUI window, but you have not seen that part of the GUI. Get someone who knows about it to&#xD;
    help.&#xD;
