    The most recent count of completed story points in an iteration is the team's velocity. The number of story points
    completed in an iteration will change over time. Consequently, the team's velocity also changes. If the team's velocity
    increases, more work can be done in each iteration. If the team's velocity decreases, less work can be done in each
    iteration.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    As the team progresses through the project, the team's understanding of the problem is improved. Customers will add new
    stories and remove others. Programmers may need to change story estimates. Consequently, the release plan should be
    revisited periodically (every few iterations or as needed).

&lt;p>
    Using the most recent velocity, the latest story estimates, and the customer's most recent view of priority, a new
    release plan is established.

    Once the plan is updated, it is critical that the whole team be aware of it. This is usually really easy as the whole
    team was involved in the revision of the release plan. The plan will show the team the progress they are making
    (morale), and they will have a clear understanding of the new target they are shooting for (team cohesion).The plan
    must be realistic and alive.
