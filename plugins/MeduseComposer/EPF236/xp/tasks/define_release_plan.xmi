    The steps for this activity are part of XP release planning. In order for this activity to be successful, the following
    preconditions should be met:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        The customer has enough user stories at present to fill at least one release.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        The customer understands the user stories very well.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        The customer has defined acceptance criteria for the stories.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        All team members that will be involved in developing the stories should be present.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;a id=&quot;Step1&quot; name=&quot;Step1&quot;>&lt;/a> 
&lt;p>
    The customer describes each story to the team and explains the conditions under which the story is going to be
    considered complete.
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_oOauMmE-EdqnIZeW8YpHcA" name="Developers Estimate the User Stories " guid="_oOauMmE-EdqnIZeW8YpHcA">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;a id=&quot;Step2&quot; name=&quot;Step2&quot;>&lt;/a> 
&lt;p>
    The developers discuss each story and come up with an estimate based on their experience. High-level design discussions
    take place as developers try to understand the story and discuss different ways of implementing it. In some cases, the
    team will not be able to provide a reasonable estimate:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        They do not understand the story: the team should be asking more questions&amp;nbsp;to the customer.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        The story is too big: the developers don't have a good grasp of the scope. It should be broken down into smaller
        stories.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        They don't know how to do it: they will need to do some research first.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    Be careful to avoid analysis paralysis. The first few times the team estimates stories, it may take as long as an hour
    to estimate a story. The second story should take less time. Your goal should be to be able to estimate a story in only
    a few minutes.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    As a rule of thumb, story estimates should not exceed the iteration length based on a pair of people dedicated to the
    story. When stories exceed the iteration length, the customer splits the story.
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

&lt;p>
    Once all the stories have an estimated cost, the customer can prioritize the stories into the release plan.The customer
    organizes stories into iterations and sequences of iterations into releases. The sum of all story points in each
    iteration cannot exceed the team's velocity. At the beginning of the project, you will have to guess the team's
    velocity. Try one third of the ideal programmer time available in an iteration. After a few iterations, revisit the
    plan and use the team's measured velocity. See more on release planning in the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;
