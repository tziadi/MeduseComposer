    The decisions that coaches make should always stem from the XP values (communication, simplicity, feedback, and&#xD;
    courage) and usually move toward the XP practices. As such, familiarity with the values and practices is a&#xD;
    prerequisite. The coach must command the respect required to lead the respective teams. The coach must possess people&#xD;
