    developing software in the face of vague or rapidly changing requirements.&quot; Simply stated, XP is a set of &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../../xp/guidances/concepts/xp_values.html&quot; guid=&quot;1.076140803519123E-306&quot;>values&lt;/a>, &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../../xp/guidances/concepts/xp_rights.html&quot; guid=&quot;3.036332011267074E-306&quot;>rights,&lt;/a>&#xD;
    and best &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../../xp/customcategories/xp_best_practices.html&quot; guid=&quot;4.315031901943112E-306&quot;>practices&lt;/a> that support each other in incrementally developing software.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When a team is developing software with XP, the customer creates stories that describe the functionality of the&#xD;
    software. These stories are very lightweight use-cases. They are small units of functionality that require less than&#xD;
    one or two weeks to implement. Programmers estimate the stories, and, based upon those estimates, the customer decides&#xD;
    which stories to do first.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Development is done iteratively and incrementally. Every two weeks, the programming team delivers working stories to&#xD;
    the customer. Then the customer chooses another two weeks worth of work. The system grows in functionality, piece by&#xD;
    piece, steered by the customer. Progress is measured and tracked based on the observable behavior of the team.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    XP relies on evolutionary design and testing techniques that maintain a high quality design while new functionality is&#xD;
    being added. These techniques avoid the mess of unmaintainable code through continuous review, an emphasis on&#xD;
    simplicity, and the backstop of nearly universal test coverage.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Programmers work on their programming tasks in pairs. The pair share a single workstation and work together to write a&#xD;
    single piece of code. Both partners are equally engaged in the writing. The keyboard moves back and forth between them&#xD;
    frequently.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    XP programmers practice Test-Driven Development. In short, they write unit tests prior to writing production code.&#xD;
    However, this is done in very tiny increments. Tiny portions of a test are written first, and then just enough&#xD;
    production code is written to make those portions pass. This continues iteratively until everything that can be&#xD;
    practically tested has been tested.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    XP focuses on continuous delivery of tested, running software from the first day of the project to the last. Delivery&#xD;
    of real software, combined with simple but frequent planning, provides stakeholders with a clear view of what is done&#xD;
    and what will be done. This enables the business to steer the project to an on-time shipment of the best possible&#xD;
    software that can be completed in the time available.&#xD;
