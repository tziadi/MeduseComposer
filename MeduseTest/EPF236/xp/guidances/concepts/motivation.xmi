  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The goal of a software process is to guide the software development organization to:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Get the right software done.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Get the software done right.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Get the software done quickly.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Get the software done frugally.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are many approaches to this problem. Some software processes are high in ceremony. They guide the developers to&#xD;
    create many artifacts. They punctuate the project with phases and sign-offs. They release infrequently, sometimes&#xD;
    solely upon project completion. There is a time and place for such processes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    On the other hand, the most important and scarce resource in any project is the time of the developers. High ceremony&#xD;
    processes fill that time with work activities that center around artifacts and reviews instead of around the core&#xD;
    artifacts of code and tests. For many projects this is an exorbitant expense.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To manage this expense, many projects need a process that uses a minimum of ceremony and concentrates on the core&#xD;
    artifacts. They need a feedback-driven process that delivers working software rapidly in quick releases.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    XP is just such a low ceremony process. It is used by those teams and for those projects where ceremony is of little&#xD;
    value, but rapid feedback is of high value. Such projects tend to be small to medium sized - fewer than one or two&#xD;
    million lines of code - and involve fewer than one or two dozen developers. They tend to exist in environments of&#xD;
    intense business and or technical change. They are, of course, exceedingly common.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A lack of ceremony does not imply a lack of management. XP places a lot of emphasis on techniques for planning,&#xD;
    estimation, and schedule management. Creating, maintaining, and managing a project plan is a very big part of XP.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A lack of ceremony also does not imply a lack of discipline. XP espouses discipline for every facet of the project.&#xD;
    There is discipline for testing, integration, planning, reviewing, and for producing software with a high quality&#xD;
    internal structure. The goal is to keep the project moving and the software easy to modify, easy to extend, and easy to&#xD;
    develop.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In short, XP puts the emphasis on ensuring that the team is working on the minimum set of activities and artifacts that&#xD;
    will produce the right software, built right, built quickly and built frugally.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
