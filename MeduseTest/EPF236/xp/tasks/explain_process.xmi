    As a team begins to use the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;
    href=&quot;./../../xp/guidances/concepts/xp_practices,2.2937799026801584E-305.html&quot; guid=&quot;2.2937799026801584E-305&quot;>XP
    Practices&lt;/a>, the coach must prepare the team to use the practices effectively.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    This includes the following:
&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>
        Teach the team about XP and ensure that the team has a common understanding of the practices.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Facilitate the team's decision as to how aggressively the transition to the new practices will be.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Facilitate a team activity to identify what obstacles they will face in using the practices effectively. Ensure
        that the team has a plan to overcome those obstacles.
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>
        Facilitate a team activity to identify what constraints will require adaptation of the practices. Ensure that these
        adaptations are understood by the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;
        href=&quot;./../../xp/guidances/concepts/whole_team,7.89591827591278E-306.html&quot; guid=&quot;7.89591827591278E-306&quot;>Whole
        Team&lt;/a>.
    &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>
    Because there are many roles in the team, a coach needs to have a good understanding of the all different activities in
    the process. In some cases, there might be more than one coach on a team to address needs. There might be a coach for
    the developer team and one for the customer team, for example.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Use external expertise as necessary to ensure the team starts with a strong base of knowledge on which to succeed.
