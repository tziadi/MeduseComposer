    When looking at an Engineering Task, you should consider how to add the capability to the system. Does the system&#xD;
    require new classes? Are there classes that would be useful? Regardless of how these decisions come out, the addition&#xD;
    of functionality requires the creation of a test case. You write the test case to demonstrate that a portion of the&#xD;
    functionality you need isn't in the system. This test case should fail.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

&lt;p>&#xD;
    When you have a failing test case, you then write only the code that is necessary to satisfy the test case. Test cases&#xD;
    should have a very narrow focus. A failing test case may trigger the creation of a new class or method named in the&#xD;
    test case, or it may simply require you to add more code to existing classes and methods.&#xD;
