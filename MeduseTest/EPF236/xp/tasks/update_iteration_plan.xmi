    The team is responsible for keeping track of its project. Tasks that are completed are marked on the iteration plan. If
    anyone on the team realizes that the team is behind schedule, at any time, the customer is informed as soon as
    possible. The customer can then decide how to change the plan. The tracker may be the first to notice that the
    iteration is in jeopardy. An XP team is considered behind schedule if half the work is not finished halfway through the
    iteration. Ideally, this could be measured by observing that half the customer tests pass halfway through the
    iteration.

&lt;p>
    When it is likely that not all the stories in the release will be finished, the customer must reduce scope. Extending
    the iteration is not an option. The customer either removes whole stories or splits stories and removes scope.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    When the team has excess capacity in the iteration, the customer is informed. The customer adds additional stories to
    fill the iteration . Customers like it when this happens.
